# Correlation Filters for Pattern Recognition

In this Repo you will find documentation of the process of exploring correlation filters and Fourier transforms to identify a human face using advanced correlation techniques. It is a project developed for the course on Optics and Acoustics from the National University of Colombia. It is carried out by:

* Diego Alejandro Herrera Rojas
* Luis Carlos Duran Neme
* Andrés Felipe Duque Bran
* Nicolás Alejandro Ávila Pérez

## Description

The aim is to develop a MATLAB - based application that may be deployed on any computer, that ultimately will identify a persons face in a scene. If possible, an Android application might be developed so that the face-recognition system can be used in a smartphone.

## Contents

The project contains the following folders:

1) **MATLABCodes**: This folder contains the MATLAB codes used to explore the capabilities of correlation techniques.
2) **images**: Contains images for filter synthesis and further facial identification processes.
3) **Figures**: Contains images for initial exploration.

## Push Formats

In order to keep track of the work, the following formats are proposed for committing files to the repository:

* All code files must be in a directory with the name **(Language)Codes**. For instance, if the codes are in MATLAB, they must be in the directory **MATLABCodes**.

* All code files must have a heading that includes: 1) Descriptive title, 2) Author's name, 3) Date of deploy, 4) Brief description. Codes must be accurately commented so that anyone can understand them.

* Al images that are not used for filter synthesis must go in the directory **Figures**. Images that are used for filter synthesis must be in directory **images**, and in a subdirectory with the name of the person to be identified.

* Al images must be stored in *PNG* format.
