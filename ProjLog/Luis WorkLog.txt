MAY 21st 2020.
Today the work was mainly focused on finishing the update of github's wiki page in terms of the VLC correlator and face recognition codes developed to date and their respective implementations. The update contains the most important results obtained at the moment alongside the issues presented and the discussions and ideas that have come up to solve them.
Additionally, the already constructed function aquire_data.m was implemented to get the Reference pictures in an easier manner, since up until now i've been taking, chopping and storing the photos one by one, which is a very unproductive to do so.
